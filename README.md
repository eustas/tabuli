### Overview

Tabuli is a project for Wave field synthesis.

The project relates to Wave field synthesis hardware simulations,
machine learning models, and other simulations.

This is a highly experimental research project at this stage.

Top level folders roughly outline the area of research / applicability.
Inside those sub-folders denote sub-projects and usually have `_v#` (version)
suffix to make it easier to track approach changes / fundamental redesigns.
